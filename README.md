# voting-meteor

This project provides a simple system that allows users to create, up-vote and comment on topics. 

Features:
- Users will create an account using a simple email so that votes / comments can be verified and to reduce spam. 
- Users can edit their own topics and delete their own comments. 
- Admin users (defined by the admin role) have full access to all topics and comments. 
- Admin users can merge topics together, and votes and comments will be transfered from the child topic to the parent. 

This project is built in Meteor as a collaboration between Code for Asheville team members. 

Code for Asheville will be using this system to assist with our "Open by Default" campaign to advocate for the adoption of an "Open Data Policy" by the City of Asheville. 

We will embed this system into the existing Wordpress site, possibly using an <iframe> for simplicity.
